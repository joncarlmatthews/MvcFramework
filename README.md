MvcFramework 
============

In 2013 I was asked to write an in-house PHP web framework. This is that framework. It look me 9 months of full time work to write. Note; this code is no longer in production and has no future use. It is here purely as a way to archive the work and to provide historical reference. There is no business logic within the code.

## Original notes:

Hand rolled leightweight PHP MVC Framework to (1) provide a consistent structure for web projects and (2) speed up development by providing utilities for common tasks.

### Project Goals

* Provide an MVC architecture for standard requests.
* Provide a rigid, yet extensible structure to encourage consistency.
* Provide a routing API.
* Provide utilities for common tasks such as database queries, validation, internationalisation & logging.
